The MSP that I have been working for at the time did not previously have a SOC team nor a SIEM solution. The first steps that we took as a team were to have a product demonstration with several vendors. Those vendors included the following:
-Splunk
-Blumira
-SecurityOnion
-Microsoft Sentinel

Next we spent time evaluating each of our options.
