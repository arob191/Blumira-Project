Here's a summary of how our team successfully set up our company's first SIEM solution, Blumira, to ingest alerts from Sentinel One, Microsoft 365, Duo Security, and Google Workspace, and how we utilized it to monitor and act on alerts:

The MSP that I have been working for at the time did not previously have a SOC team nor a SIEM solution. The first steps that we took as a team were to have a product demonstration with several vendors. Those vendors included the following:

- Splunk
- Blumira
- SecurityOnion
- Microsoft Sentinel

Next we spent time evaluating each of our options. After weighing the pros and cons of each solution we ended up going with Blumira since it best fit our small MSP.
